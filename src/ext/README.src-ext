This folder contains bundled code from third parties. Licences for each are
included under their sub-folders. Distributions packaging kWIP will probably
want to exclude this, and package each component separately.

Bundled code:

 - khmer: The k-mer counting and graph algorithm library. We bundle khmer's C++
   library only as we don't utilise the python interface or scripts.

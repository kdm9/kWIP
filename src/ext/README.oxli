This is the `lib` subdirectory of khmer version 2.0's source tarball
(https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/archive/v2.0.tar.gz). I have moved
MurmurHash3.* from the `third-party/smhasher` directory of khmer, and deleted
all testing code from lib (source files test-Colours.cc, test-compile.cc and
.check_openmp.cc).
